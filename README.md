# GoBike-Stats
This project analyzes ride data from the Bay Wheels (formerly Ford GoBike) bikeshare program operated in the San Francisco Bay Area by Motivate starting in 2017. My statistical analysis focuses on the city of Berkeley, where I live, but extends to Oakland, Emeryville, San Francisco, and San Jose. It uses publicly available data and open-source Python code to examine ridership and system usage.

### How to Use ###
The main document is GoBike_ride_stats.ipynb, a Jupyter notebook that walks through various explorations and visualizations of system usage, including: ridership numbers, ride times, gender splits, and station use.

That notebook depends on raw data that *are not included* here. Please download the public "...-tripdata.csv" files directly from the Bay Wheels website (https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data) and place them in the same directory as GoBike_ride_stats.ipynb.
